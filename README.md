# Snapshooter

An implementation of the _snapshot interpolation_ algorithm over _Unity 3D_.
The game is basically a __FPS__ (_First Person Shooter_), with a simple map,
simple rules, maximum fixed players, a sniper rifle with hit-scan (instant
hit), infinite granades (no kidding), _pseudo lag-compensation_ (it is _pseudo_
because its not validated), and possibly, _prediction_.

Oh... and you can't die.
